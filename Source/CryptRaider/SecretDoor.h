// SecretDoor.h
// Defines a secret door that can be unlocked by specific actions, 
// such as detecting actors with specific tags and allowing dynamic
// interactions in the game world.
//
// Responsibilities:
// - Detect overlapping actors with designated unlocking tags.
// - Activate and deactivate the door based on specific conditions.
// - Support interaction logic for secret door mechanics.
