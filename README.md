# CryptRaider
 Small example of using enhanced Input and Actor Components using C++
 
 So, this project wasn't uploaded completely to github. Just the source files for checking the code. The game is built and you can download it here:

This was just a simple example for creating actor components. And also, testing the enhanced input system. I didn't want to waste time by doing a proper game, just testing functionality, so when you enter this game you will be very lost.

The only thing you can do is look for an Item that looks like a small statue, that you can grab with LMB, and place in a pedestal that seems iluminated. This pedestal will move up once you release the statue on it.

So we are testing grabber with physics component in the player, and also a movement component to move the wall of the crypt where the pedestal is.
